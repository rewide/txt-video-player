# txt-video-player
A command-line video player written in Rust!
Requires ffmpeg installed.

### Usage:
`cargo run PATH/TO/VIDEO.mp4`
or
`cargo run` <- this will attempt to find `input.mp4` file in default Videos folder on your OS

It is pretty much a one-to-one rewrite of my older C# txt-video-player, which was based on some random tutorial.
After writing this, I realized how verbose Rust is :/
